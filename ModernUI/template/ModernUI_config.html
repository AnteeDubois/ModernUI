 *
 * TOP MENU SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS
 * ModernUI can be configured to show Facebook and Twitter icons in the top
 * left corner of the style, next to the Feed icon and search box.
 * In order to enable these and configure them to link to your Facebook and/or
 * Twitter page, you'll need to enable the variables below and set the URLs.
 * Firstly, set $FB_DISPLAY or $TWITTER_DISPLAY to 'on'
 *
 * EXAMPLE: <!-- DEFINE $FB_DISPLAY = 'on' -->
<!--
 * Then, change the $FB_URL and $TWITTER_URL variables to your profile URL
 *
 * EXAMPLE: <!-- DEFINE $FB_URL = 'http://www.twitter.com/phpbb' -->
<!--
 * The third variable, $FB_TEXT and $TWITTER_TEXT are optional. This is the text
 * that displays as an alternate if the images can't be loaded, the text that
 * displays on mouseover of the image.
 * It is recommended that you alter these to your primary language.
 *
 * Additional support can be obtained at:
